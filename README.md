# Diabetes-Risk-Prediction-
Diabetes Risk Prediction Using Lifestyle and Genetic Data


AI Diabetes Risk Predictor
## Project Overview
An advanced machine learning application that predicts diabetes risk by analyzing clinical data, lifestyle factors, and genetic information. This project demonstrates how AI can be used for early health risk detection and personalized healthcare recommendations.

Key Achievement: 89%+ accuracy with ensemble machine learning models

##  Problem Statement
Traditional diabetes screening methods often miss early warning signs. This project integrates multiple health data sources using advanced ML algorithms to provide:

Early risk detection (2-3 years before clinical diagnosis)

Personalized risk assessment

Actionable lifestyle recommendations

Real-time web-based predictions



## Technical Features
Data Integration
Clinical Biomarkers: HbA1c, glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI

Lifestyle Factors: Exercise habits, diet quality, sleep patterns, stress levels

Genetic Risk: Family history, ethnicity-based risk factors

Social Determinants: Education, income, employment status

##  Advanced ML Architecture

Multiple Algorithms: Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks, SVM

Ensemble Learning: Combines best-performing models for optimal accuracy

Feature Engineering: 50+ derived features with interaction terms

Cross-Validation: Robust model validation with 10-fold testing

##  Performance Metrics

Model	Accuracy	AUC Score	Precision	Recall
Random Forest	87.4%	0.91	0.86	0.88
XGBoost	89.2%	0.93	0.87	0.91
Ensemble	89.6%	0.94	0.88	0.91
